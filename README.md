The get_next_line project is a programming exercise that teaches students how to read text files line by line in C. The goal of the project is to create a function called get_next_line that takes a file descriptor as input and returns a pointer to the next line of text in the file. The function should also handle the possibility of reading multiple lines from the file.

Key features of the get_next_line project:

Reads text files line by line without knowing the file size beforehand.
Handles multiple lines in a file.
Ensures no memory leaks occur.
Uses a variable-length buffer for reading.
Bonus features:

Supports multiple file reads simultaneously.
Handles error conditions gracefully.
Adheres to the standards of the C programming language.
Overall, the get_next_line project is a valuable exercise for students learning C programming. It teaches them how to handle file I/O and how to write efficient and memory-safe code.
